Engineering economy is a branch of economics that applies economic theories and principles to engineering problems involving cost and benefit analysis. It helps engineers and decision-makers to evaluate the feasibility and desirability of different alternatives and choose the best one among them.
 
One of the books that covers this topic is Engineering Economy by Matias Arreola, a registered civil engineer and former professor in the Philippines and the USA. The book was first published in 1979 and has been revised several times since then. The latest edition is the third edition, which was published in 2007.

The book also includes appendices that provide sample tests, guidelines for preparing a feasibility study, and tables of interest factors and depreciation rates. The book uses examples and problems from various engineering fields, such as civil, mechanical, electrical, industrial, and agricultural engineering. The book also incorporates Philippine laws and regulations that affect engineering projects, such as the National Building Code, the National Internal Revenue Code, and the Environmental Impact Statement System.
 
The book is intended for undergraduate students who are taking engineering economy courses as part of their curriculum. It can also be used by practicing engineers who need to refresh their knowledge or learn new concepts and techniques in engineering economy. The book is written in a clear and concise manner, with explanations, illustrations, formulas, tables, graphs, and charts to aid the reader's understanding. The book also provides exercises and problems at the end of each chapter to test the reader's comprehension and application skills.
 
In conclusion, Engineering Economy by Matias Arreola is a comprehensive and useful book that covers the essential topics and methods of engineering economy. It is suitable for both students and professionals who want to learn how to apply economic principles to engineering problems and make rational decisions based on cost and benefit analysis.
  
One of the strengths of the book is that it provides a balanced approach to engineering economy, considering both the technical and the social aspects of engineering projects. The book emphasizes the importance of engineering ethics and social responsibility, as well as the environmental and human impacts of engineering decisions. The book also discusses the role of engineers in society and their obligations to their clients, employers, colleagues, and the public.
 
Another strength of the book is that it reflects the current trends and developments in engineering economy, such as the use of computer software, spreadsheet applications, and online resources. The book also incorporates the latest standards and practices in engineering economy, such as the Engineering Economy Code of Ethics, the Engineering Economy Accreditation Criteria, and the Engineering Economy Body of Knowledge. The book also updates the data and information on various economic factors, such as interest rates, inflation rates, tax rates, and exchange rates.
 
However, the book also has some limitations that could be improved in future editions. One limitation is that the book does not cover some topics that are relevant to engineering economy, such as life cycle costing, sustainability analysis, social cost-benefit analysis, and multicriteria decision making. These topics are becoming more important in engineering practice and research, as engineers face more complex and dynamic problems that require a holistic and systemic approach. Another limitation is that the book does not provide enough examples and problems from other countries and regions, especially from developing countries and emerging economies. These examples and problems could help the reader to appreciate the diversity and challenges of engineering economy in different contexts and settings.
